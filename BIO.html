                <p>As a dedicated and driven individual, I embarked on a remarkable journey that took me from the 
                    disciplined life of the United States Navy to becoming a distinguished CIP 
                    (Critical Infrastructure Protection) Technical Advisor for San Diego Gas & Electric. 
                    My career is a testament to my unwavering commitment, adaptability, and passion for 
                    technology and cybersecurity. <br><br>Born and raised with a strong sense of duty and discipline, I chose to serve my country 
                    by joining the United States Navy. I enlisted as an Information Systems Professional, and over six years 
                    of service, I honed my technical skills while simultaneously imbibing the Navy's core values of honor, 
                    courage, and commitment. My time in the Navy exposed me to the importance of secure communication systems 
                    and the critical role of information technology in modern military operations. After my honorable discharge 
                    from the Navy, I faced a pivotal moment in my life. Drawing from my experience as an Information Systems 
                    Professional, I decided to channel my technical expertise into the civilian world. I embarked on a journey 
                    of self-improvement and skill enhancement to transition seamlessly into a new career.</p>
